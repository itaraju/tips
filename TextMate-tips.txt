- integration with RMarkdown
bundle: https://github.com/streeter/markdown-redcarpet.tmbundle
added menu "knit this" to markdown-redcarpet bundle: with code from: https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/252#issuecomment-6034068
had to create symbolic links in /usr/local/bin to: pdflatex and pandoc-citeproc

- new menu (edit bundle Markdown-RedCarpet):
Name: Insert R block
scope: text.html.markdown.redcarpet
Tab Trigger: R
content:
\`\`\`{r ${1:block}${2|\, cache=TRUE,,\, fig.cap="",\, results='asis'|}}
${3:code}
\`\`\`

- new menu (edit bundle Markdown-RedCarpet):
Name: Insert inline R
scope: text.html.markdown.redcarpet
Tab Trigger: r
content:
\`r ${1:code}\`


Improvements to Markdown-RedCarpet todo:
----------------------------------------

- set color to equations: block: $$ ... $$, inline: $..$ (maybe even: synthax highlight inside)
- set color to references: [@ref], @ref, {#ref}, {@ref}
- set background color to code blocks
- index code blocks in symbols list (shift-cmd-T)
- insert code block: include {}
- help R command

Done with edit bundle
---------------------



```{r ${1:block}}

```

6: text.gsub!(/\s{1,}/," ")
