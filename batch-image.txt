Batch image convertion / processing
-----------------------------------

For example the following command would resize all .jpg images in a directory to 640x480, with quality setting 86 (you can choose between 0 and 100) and strip EXIF data from them to make files even smaller:

find . -iname "*.jpg" -exec convert -resize 640x480 -quality 86 -strip {};

There's actually a nice Nautilus extension (that uses Imagemagick) in Ubuntu repositories that allows you to just select all images you want to resize, right-click, select 'Resize Images' and choose the size you want from a GUI menu. To get it run the following command and log out &back again (or 'killall nautilus'):
sudo apt-get install nautilus-image-converter


----------------------
opção para scala, sem especificar a resolucao final:
convert file1.jpg -scale 25% file-final.jpg
