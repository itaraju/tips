This is a simple report, to exemplify some ideas.
The cars dataset has cars using these cylinders: CylList.

This table shows the minimum and maximum HP for each cylinder category:

include(table.md)

The relation between cylinder category and HP is better shown in next figure:
![boxplot HP by cylinder category](fig.pdf)

That's it for now.
