Init:

	cd ~/Projects
	mkdir test
	cd !$
	git init
	echo "file1" > a.txt
	git add a.txt
	git commit -m "init"

Change 1

	echo "file2" > b.txt
	echo "ch1" >> a.txt
	git add b.txt
	git commit -a -m "change1"

Change 2

	echo "file3" > c.txt
	echo "ch2" >> a.txt
	echo "ch2" >> b.txt
	git add c.txt
	git commit -a -m "change2"

Change 3

	echo "file4" > d.txt
	echo "ch3" >> a.txt
	echo "ch3" >> b.txt	
	echo "ch3" >> c.txt	
	git add d.txt
	git commit -a -m "change3"

log:

	git log --oneline

Reseting to "Change 1" commit: files remain the way they were after "change 3"

	git reset ebdaaa8

And c.txt and d.txt are untracked now.

Committing changes back:

	git add .
	git commit -m "added back"

log:

	git log --oneline

Reseting to "Change 1" commit, not preserving the working tree: files go back to what they were after "Change 1" commit:

	git reset --hard ebdaaa8
