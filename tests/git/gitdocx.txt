Goal: to keep track of changes in docx document in git

hopefully, changes tracked include:
- all text
- paragraphs and spacing
- main font formating
- tables

reference:
https://hrishioa.github.io/tracking-word-documents-with-git/

It's enough to have these 2 steps:

1) .gitattributes with:

*.docx diff=pandoc

2) Add to .git/config:

[diff "pandoc"]
  textconv=pandoc --to=markdown
  prompt = false
