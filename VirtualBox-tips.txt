the VM

booting onto text mode
======================

Permanently Set a Default Runlevel:
Open a Terminal.
Become root:
su -

Open the file /etc/inittab in your favorite text editor:
gedit /etc/inittab

Find the line:
id:number:initdefault:

where number is your current default runlevel (probably 5).

Change the number in the middle of the line to the new runlevel that you want your computer to start in by default. For example, if you want to start in text-only mode by default, change it to:
id:3:initdefault:

You will then boot into that runlevel every time you start the computer.



install Virtualbox guest additions on Fedora

- run: sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run

Shared folders
==============

/etc/fstab:
tmpshare	/mnt/tmp	vboxsf	uid=<user>,rw,defaults,nofail

Tips from: https://serverfault.com/a/674975

For VirtualBox with a Linux guest, these are the steps to mount a shared
folder:

1.    Use the VirtualBox host's application, VirtualBox Manager, to specify
host folders to share.

2.    Make sure VirtualBox Guest Additions are installed in the VirtualBox
guest.

3.    In the Linux guest, the mount command should show a line that the share
was mounted. This is indicated by type vboxsf. The issue becomes that the mount
point may not be where desired, and the permissions are root only. The default
mount location is in /media/sf_.

4.    You can access the share by making the user, or group id of 1000, a
member of group vboxsf. This is done by changing the vboxsf line in the
/etc/group file. May require reboot.

5.    You can change where the folder is mounted by using the VBoxControl
command. The command is installed when Guest Additions is installed. May
require reboot. For example, to change the mount point from /media/sf_... to
/home/toto/sf_... use the following command to set the VirtualBox shared folder
guestproperty:

6.    sudo VBoxControl guestproperty set
/VirtualBox/GuestAdd/SharedFolders/MountDir /home/toto/

To confirm the change, use get:

sudo VBoxControl guestproperty get /VirtualBox/GuestAdd/SharedFolders/MountDir

----
from: https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#sharedfolders

The guest properties /VirtualBox/GuestAdd/SharedFolders/MountDir and the more
generic /VirtualBox/GuestAdd/SharedFolders/MountPrefix can be used to override
the automatic mount directory and prefix

## problem: video

There was a problem, where screen would not refresh (even at login screen) if
on Full screen mode. Solution was to increase video memory in the virtual
machine settings (from initial 16Mb to 64Mb)


fedora booting into emergency mode:
===================================
(https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=49940)

> After reading A LOT on the issue, I found some posts for Fedora 16 stating that a problem with mounting the /home partition was the cause of the dependency failure. I added "nofail" to the options in /etc/fstab after "defaults" and it works like a charm now. Hope this helps someone else in a similar spot.

> It turns out, I had added a line to my /etc/fstab to auto-mount one of my Virtualbox shared folders. By upgrading the kernel, I (obviously) lost the kernel module that mount relies on, and so it was forcing the emergency mode message. By adding nofail to the options, it allows me to boot, install the guest additions, and reboot. No more emergency mode!


VM performance:
===============
- remove virtual disk from antivirus scanning
- make virtual disk fixed size
- increase cpu?
- video memory to the maximum (enable accelaration options)

Increase the minimun CPU speed(?):
http://www.rawinfopages.com/tips/2015/05/speed-up-virtualbox-enormously-with-this-simple-tweak/

    To do this, go to Power Options in the Control Panel and next to the Power
    saver plan, click Change plan settings.

    On the next screen, click Change advanced power settings. Expand Processor
    power management, Minimum processor state, and set Plugged in to 80% or
    whatever value gives reasonable performance in the virtual machine.


Adding new disk to VM VirtualBox
================================

- created snapshot (2019-02-20)
- added new disk .vdi 10Gb, name: linux-home.vdi

- following lvm.md: adding new disk/partition/volume

- at end:
4- Mount it
# mkdir /media/newhome
# chmod 777 /media/newhome
# mount /dev/vg_home/lv_home /media/newhome

6- Copying home content

First: logout, login using text mode (ctl-alt-f2 in login window, login to user)
[in first atempt, this was performed only on step 7, but it's better if done here,
as it will reduce the number of diff files]

# cp -aRv /home/* /media/newhome/
# diff -rq /home /media/newhome

5- Add it to fstab
/dev/vg_home/lv_home     /media/newhome     ext4     defaults     0 2
or
/dev/mapper/vg_home-lv_home /home   ext4    defaults    0 2

7- Swapping volumes

# umount /media/newhome
# mv home old-home
# mkdir home
# mount /dev/mapper/vg_home-lv_home /home

Check if things still look good

# exit (root)
% cd /
% diff -rq /home /media/newhome

8- Reboot
