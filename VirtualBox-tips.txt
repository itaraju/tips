booting onto text mode
======================

Permanently Set a Default Runlevel:
Open a Terminal.
Become root:
su -

Open the file /etc/inittab in your favorite text editor:
gedit /etc/inittab

Find the line:
id:number:initdefault:

where number is your current default runlevel (probably 5).

Change the number in the middle of the line to the new runlevel that you want your computer to start in by default. For example, if you want to start in text-only mode by default, change it to:
id:3:initdefault:

You will then boot into that runlevel every time you start the computer.

Shared folders
==============

/etc/fstab:
tmpshare	/mnt/tmp	vboxsf	uid=<user>,rw,defaults,nofail

Tips from: https://serverfault.com/a/674975

For VirtualBox with a Linux guest, these are the steps to mount a shared
folder:

1.    Use the VirtualBox host's application, VirtualBox Manager, to specify
host folders to share.

2.    Make sure VirtualBox Guest Additions are installed in the VirtualBox
guest.

3.    In the Linux guest, the mount command should show a line that the share
was mounted. This is indicated by type vboxsf. The issue becomes that the mount
point may not be where desired, and the permissions are root only. The default
mount location is in /media/sf_.

4.    You can access the share by making the user, or group id of 1000, a
member of group vboxsf. This is done by changing the vboxsf line in the
/etc/group file. May require reboot.

5.    You can change where the folder is mounted by using the VBoxControl
command. The command is installed when Guest Additions is installed. May
require reboot. For example, to change the mount point from /media/sf_... to
/home/toto/sf_... use the following command to set the VirtualBox shared folder
guestproperty:

6.    sudo VBoxControl guestproperty set
/VirtualBox/GuestAdd/SharedFolders/MountDir /home/toto/

To confirm the change, use get:

sudo VBoxControl guestproperty get /VirtualBox/GuestAdd/SharedFolders/MountDir

----
from: https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#sharedfolders

The guest properties /VirtualBox/GuestAdd/SharedFolders/MountDir and the more
generic /VirtualBox/GuestAdd/SharedFolders/MountPrefix can be used to override
the automatic mount directory and prefix

## problem: video

There was a problem, where screen would not refresh (even at login screen) if
on Full screen mode. Solution was to increase video memory in the virtual
machine settings (from initial 16Mb to 64Mb)


fedora booting into emergency mode:
===================================
(https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=49940)

> After reading A LOT on the issue, I found some posts for Fedora 16 stating that a problem with mounting the /home partition was the cause of the dependency failure. I added "nofail" to the options in /etc/fstab after "defaults" and it works like a charm now. Hope this helps someone else in a similar spot.

> It turns out, I had added a line to my /etc/fstab to auto-mount one of my Virtualbox shared folders. By upgrading the kernel, I (obviously) lost the kernel module that mount relies on, and so it was forcing the emergency mode message. By adding nofail to the options, it allows me to boot, install the guest additions, and reboot. No more emergency mode!
